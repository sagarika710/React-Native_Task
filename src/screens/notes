for fontawesome
------
1.npm i react-native-vector-icons
2.here i install bt it wonot come


here why we need to link some packages 

if you need any package then just go in npmjs.come
then just select package and copy installation code
then just paste here

ok but here some packages need to link and some not need 
to link

so just check out in documentation page where is link is needed then only link 

and main question is why wee need to link package you know ?
no

fontawesome and others are icon packages are included in react-native-vector-icons 
ok but when we install package its install in node_modules folder 

but there is icons so it need some files so that we need to link 
with linking package it just copy resources and other nessasary files in android 
project folder let me show you 

we had just linked react-native-vector-icons package ok so it just copy resources like 
fontawesome5 or other icon files in android folder here

so that now you can use it
android\app\src\main\assets\fonts


now use
=================================
1.// this is our main package now we only need fontawsome so just use like this
// now give name here what ever you like give name now i got it
2.may i copy that link here??which ?npx react-native link <package_name>
    npx react-native link  react-native-vector-icons
    ok okok
that why we gave name ="" in fontawesome now i got it ok 

so you just need to select file

open conssole and presss r for reload so its fix

some error occurs so lets clear android build

no error from our side

just goto android folder and enter command

gradlew clean

ok its done
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
default in react native scroll view is always prefer vertical first
so they set default direction to vertical so in our case we just need horizontal
so thats why horizontal={true} so it convert list to horizontal

and main thing see here so just we need to give height

this type of mistack is common for me i always face this but every time i do same

so you just remember just add view and then just put that scrollvieew in it okok
ok no need to writes
